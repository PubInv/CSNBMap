# VestaReady
Repo to hold work for 2016 Nasa Space Apps Challenge, seeking teammates!

It's 10:38 AM CST and I'm beginning the Vesta Revealed challenge.  Seeking collaborators.  Not sure what I'm doing here. Trying to get a handle on the Digital elevation data.  I Barely understand what CSNB is, but am game to try.  Contact me if you are interested in collaboration.

My plan now is to either figure out the data formats.  I may allow either a computed features to be created or I may create a system for interactively drawing a feature.  

I'm pretty ignorant of cartography.  It is not even clear to me precisely what the challenge is asking for.
